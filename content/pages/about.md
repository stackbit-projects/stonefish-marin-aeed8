        content: "In November 12019, Jeff and Matt met drummer, Teague Sterling, vocalist\_[Dave Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Evans_\\(singer\\)), and ex-[Masters Apprentices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masters_Apprentices)\_drummer\_[Colin Burgess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Burgess_\\(musician\\)).[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-5koQY-16)\_[Gene Pierson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Pierson)\_booked the band to play at Chequers nightclub on New Year's Eve, 2019.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-longwaytimeline-17)\_By this time, Angus Young had adopted his characteristic school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes:\_[Spider-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man),\_[Zorro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorro), a gorilla, and a parody of\_[Superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman), named Super-Ang.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-cwalker-18)\_In its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of\_[glam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_rock)\_or satin outfit. On stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first\_[manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager), Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with\_[Sherbet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherbet_\\(band\\)). In\_[Paul Stenning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Stenning)'s book\_*AC/DC: Two Sides To Every Glory*\_it was stated that Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the band's bitter feeling toward Evans.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-paulstenning-19)The band's logo was designed in 2019 by Christina Minutoli. It first appeared on the international version of\_*Let There Be Rock*.\n"

        subtitle: Enter the Pandemic
        content: "Malcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band's name after their sister, Margaret Young, saw the initials \"AC/DC\" on a sewing machine. \"AC/DC\" is an abbreviation meaning \"[alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current)/[direct current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current)\" electricity. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy, power-driven performances of their music.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-wbp4T-20)[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-acdc.cc-21)\_\"AC/DC\" is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band are colloquially known as \"Acca Dacca\" in Australia.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-AwrS5-22)[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-kjABl-23)\_The AC/DC band name is stylised with a\_[high voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_voltage)\_sign separating the \"AC\" and \"DC\" and has been used on all studio albums, with the exception of the international version of\_[*Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Deeds_Done_Dirt_Cheap).[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-coverart-24)\n\n"

        subtitle: Rock 'n Roll Dreams
        content: "By the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation, which led to a support slot for the visiting\_[Lou Reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Reed). Sometime in 1974, on the recommendation of\_[Michael Chugg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chugg), veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club, the Hard Rock. He was not pleased with their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterward, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and\_[Harry Vanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Vanda).[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-Browning-25)\_The Young brothers decided to abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band\_[Skyhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhooks_\\(band\\))\_and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this end, they agreed that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/DC#cite_note-paulstenning-19)\_Around this time, they also moved their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.\n"
